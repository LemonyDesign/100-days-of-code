# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not such a resultsy hour... will need to take a step back and get down to testing basics to work up my first few. I have got my custom hook shared to two forms, so that's all good. 

**Thoughts:** Testing basics: good old KCD-time

### Day 2: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Success! Acheived a satisfying refactor of onChange form fields (including password reset and form reset functionality) as a custom hook, allowing abstraction and re-useability of the useFormFields hook in my login component (and any other forms) - which should keep things neat.

**Thoughts:** Testing of the custom hook is the next step - [Test custom hooks with enzyme](https://dev.to/flexdinesh/react-hooks-test-custom-hooks-with-enzyme-40ib)

### Day 1: January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Slipped backwards while going forwards. A bit of reading about testing of Hooks-based components leads me down a side-alley endeavouring to create custom hooks for - initially - input changes in the component, that can then be neatly used for testing

**Thoughts:** Not sure if this is the best way to go (is this going to be necessary for all my state hooks? However, the refactor to custom hooks seems neat. Getting there. An hour is a very short time for this (but also need to have a life following work hours)

### Day 0: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started work on unit tests for React Register component. Outlined the tests I want to make.

**Thoughts:** I have recently been learning React Hooks (having spent over 6 months away from React, learning Angular, I'm returning to a literal new state (useState) of play. And finding that testing state on a Hooks functional component is going to challenge my initial test
